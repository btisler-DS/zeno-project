# Zeno Non-Commercial License — Legal FAQ
Version 0.2 • Updated: 2025-11-23

This document explains the legal meaning, intent, and operational implications of the Zeno Non-Commercial License (ZNL). It is written to assist researchers, independent developers, and organizations in understanding what is permitted and prohibited under the license.

## 1. How is the Zeno License different from CC BY-NC-SA 4.0?

ZNL is **substantially stronger** than Creative Commons non-commercial licenses because it regulates:

- **use**
- **integration**
- **evaluation**
- **downstream outputs**
- **derivative testing methodologies**
- **model-score publication**

CC BY-NC-SA does not restrict use; ZNL does.  
ZNL functions as a **binding software license + methodology license**, not just a distribution license.

---

## 2. What counts as “commercial use”?

A use is commercial if it benefits a for-profit entity in any of these ways:

- revenue generation  
- product development or R&D  
- internal model evaluation or QA  
- competitive advantage  
- customer acquisition  
- investor relations or fundraising  
- integration into commercial workflows  

Even if **no money changes hands**, benefit to a commercial actor qualifies as commercial use.

## 3. Can companies run Zeno internally for research?

No — *not without a commercial license*.  
Zeno’s core value is diagnostic evaluation; internal benchmarking is a commercial advantage.

---

## 4. Can someone modify or fork Zeno?

Yes, but **only for non-commercial purposes**.  
Modified versions also inherit the non-commercial clauses.

---

## 5. Are AI-generated outputs also restricted?

Yes.  
All logs, evaluation results, and derivative artifacts produced through Zeno pipelines are subject to the same non-commercial rules.  
This prevents “shadow commercialization.”

---

## 6. Can a journalist, student, or academic researcher use Zeno?

Yes — provided the work is not commissioned by a commercial entity.

---

## 7. What happens if someone violates the license?

Violations cause **automatic termination of all rights**.  
Continued use becomes copyright infringement.

---

## 8. Is the license legally enforceable?

Yes.  
Courts recognize that:

> “Use of software constitutes assent to the license.”

ZNL is a standard contractual license with revocable permission. Non-compliance is actionable.

---

## 9. How do organizations obtain a commercial license?

Contact the project owner to negotiate terms.

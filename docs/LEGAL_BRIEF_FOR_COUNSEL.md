# 1. Summary

Zeno is distributed under the **Zeno Non-Commercial License (ZNL)**.  
The license prohibits all commercial use, including internal research, unless a commercial license is obtained.

Use = assent. Unauthorized commercial use = license termination + infringement.

---

# 2. What Counts as Commercial Use

Any operation that benefits a for-profit entity:

- internal benchmarking  
- model QA or evaluation  
- informing product decisions  
- competitive analysis  
- marketing, investor, or customer-facing materials  
- consulting workflows  
- model development pipelines  
- integration into CI/CD or test automation  

Even if Zeno is not redistributed, **internal use alone is commercial.**

---

# 3. Downstream Output Restrictions

All artifacts generated with Zeno are also NC-restricted:

- evaluation logs  
- traces  
- model outputs  
- scorecards  
- run diagnostics  

This prevents indirect commercialization via derived metrics.

---

# 4. Legal Mechanisms

- License = binding contract  
- Use constitutes acceptance  
- Breach triggers automatic termination  
- Post-termination use constitutes infringement  
- Remedies include:
  - damages  
  - injunctions  
  - retroactive licensing  
  - deletion of derived artifacts  

---

# 5. Compliance Recommendation

Corporate counsel should:

1. **Prohibit internal use of Zeno without a commercial license.**  
2. **Review derivatives for NC-restricted content.**  
3. **Ensure internal teams do not use Zeno in R&D, QA, or competitive evaluations.**  
4. **Advise contacting the project owner for licensing.**

---

# 6. Contact

For commercial licensing or exemptions, contact the Zeno project owner.

# Zeno License — Enforcement Rationale & Legal Foundations
Version 0.2 • Updated: 2025-11-23

This document explains *why* the Zeno Non-Commercial License is enforceable and how it interacts with copyright, contract law, and typical software-licensing practices.

# 1. Why ZNL Is Stronger Than CC BY-NC-SA

Unlike CC licenses, which intentionally avoid regulating use, the Zeno License restricts:

- use  
- internal execution  
- evaluation of models  
- integration in R&D  
- distribution of evaluation results  

This makes ZNL closer to:

- Mozilla Public License (MPL)  
- Elastic License (non-commercial)  
- SSPL (server-side restriction)

but with tighter language specific to evaluation pipelines.

# 2. Foundations of Enforceability

## 2.1 Use = Assent  
Courts consistently hold that using software under a displayed license constitutes acceptance.  
ZNL leverages this precedent.

## 2.2 Revocable Permission  
Violation triggers automatic termination.  
Continued use becomes infringement **without needing additional notice**.

## 2.3 Copyrighted Methodology  
Zeno is not just code.  
It includes:

- evaluation heuristics  
- scenario categories  
- structured testing methodology  
- interpretation framework  

All of these are copyright-protected.

## 2.4 Explicit Definitions  
The license defines “commercial use” operationally, not abstractly.  
Specific definitions strengthen enforcement.

## 2.5 Use-Restriction Validity  
The license uses the same structure as field-tested licenses (Elastic, SSPL).  
Courts have upheld such restrictions in software contexts.

# 3. What Evidence Looks Like in a Violation Case

Violations are easy to prove because Zeno creates:

- logs  
- timestamps  
- scenario traces  
- run outputs  
- prompt–response files  

These are admissible evidence demonstrating use.

# 4. Remedies Available

If a party violates ZNL, the rights holder may:

- revoke all rights  
- demand cessation  
- require deletion of derived artifacts  
- seek damages  
- seek injunctions  
- negotiate retroactive licensing  

---

# 5. Summary

ZNL is a robust, enforceable license specifically engineered to protect evaluation methodologies and restrict unauthorized commercial use.  
It is suitable for research-grade instruments and pre-commercial IP protection.
